## About

This project was created as a part of a course on database systems at Rutgers. The main objective was to learn how to use SQL to query, manipulate, and analyze large datasets. The project also involved creating stored procedures, functions, triggers, and views to automate and simplify some tasks.

The project focused on the US presidential election data. The data contained information about the state, locality, precinct, total votes, and votes for each candidate. The project aimed to answer some interesting questions such as:

- How many votes did each candidate get in each state and locality?
- Which states and localities had the highest and lowest voter turnout?
- Which states and localities had the most and least competitive races?
- Which states and localities had the most and least changes in voting preferences between 2020 and 2024?
- Which states and localities had the most and least anomalies or irregularities in the voting data?

The project used MySQL as the database management system.
